# Amz-reviews-Analysis
Imagine to be a firm that wants to launch a new product on the market and to understand customers' opinion on competitors' products without performing an expensive survey. For this purpose, an online analysis based on online reviews is conducted.

A basic approach to perform an analysis on online reviews is by performing: 
* web_scraping to retrieve the data: customers' reviews and the corresponding rating
* perform sentiment analysis which is a manifold activity: 
  * binary classification: differentiate between positive and negative reviews
  * create a world cloud in order to understand which are the most occuring words for both positive and negative comments
  * estimate the overall sentiment that araises from all the product reviews. 

Another approach could be retrieving the data from the tables that describe products' attributes and use them as predictors and the average rating as response variable and then perform some kind of regression to understand which predictors are particularly relevant.
